# Your First Fungible Asset

This tutorial introduces how you can compile, deploy, and mint your own fungible asset (FA), named [Moon Coin](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/aptos-move/move-examples/fungible_asset/moon_coin).
Make sure you have understood FA before moving on to the tutorial. If not, it is highly recommended to read it first.

* [Fungible Asset](../standards/fungible-asset.md)

## Step 1: Pick an SDK

Install your preferred SDK from the below list:

* [TypeScript SDK](../sdks/ts-sdk/index.md)
* [Python SDK](../sdks/python-sdk.md)
* [Rust SDK](../sdks/rust-sdk.md)

---

## Step 2: Install the CLI

[Install the precompiled binary for the Aptos CLI](../tools/install-cli/index.md).

---

## Step 3: Run the example

Clone the `aptos-core` repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git
```

<Tabs groupId="examples">
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

Navigate to the TypeScript SDK directory:

```bash
cd ~/aptos-core/ecosystem/typescript/sdk
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the TypeScript [`your_fungible_asset`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/ecosystem/typescript/sdk/examples/typescript/your_fungible_asset.ts) example:

```bash
cd examples/typescript
pnpm your_fungible_asset ~/aptos-core/aptos-move/move-examples/fungible_asset/moon_coin
```

### Step 3.1: Build the package

The example run will pause with the following output:

```bash
=== Addresses ===
Alice: 0xa816be8abfbcb2c61fd5032715a8ff4155fd19ad67b379c4482bf0a10d320ed9
Bob: 0xcdbbbb3b6ad9902b49b9055fa907272a701c00abcaf1ea59a4b1ae1ba761bb69
Charlie: 0xe664111a5e56f69128b72fcc30c1b41745b74d7a51e3528b5e110cad8203b3e6
Update the package with Alice's address, compile, and press enter.
```

At this point, open another terminal and change directories to the StarCoin package's directory:

```bash
cd ~/aptos-core/aptos-move/move-examples/fungible_asset/moon_coin
```

Next, build the package using the CLI:

```bash
aptos move compile --named-addresses MoonCoin=0x47f0713212178a7aca75a3f72b58a9919838083cfd6b4df89ad48f029e004d16 --save-metadata
```

The `--named-addresses` is a list of address mappings that must be translated in order for the package to be compiled to be stored in Alice's account. Notice how `MoonCoin` is set to Alice's address printed above. Also `--save-metadata` is required to publish the package.

---

### Step 3.2: Completing the example

Returning to the previous prompt, press ENTER as the package is now ready to be published.

The application will complete, printing:

```bash
Publishing MoonCoin package.

All the balances in this exmaple refer to balance in primary fungible stores of each account.
Alice's initial MoonCoin balance: 0.
Bob's initial MoonCoin balance: 0.
Charlie's initial balance: 0.
Alice mints Charlie 100 coins.
Charlie's updated MoonCoin primary fungible store balance: 100.
Alice freezes Bob's account.
Alice as the admin forcefully transfers the newly minted coins of Charlie to Bob ignoring that Bob's account is frozen.
Bob's updated MoonCoin balance: 100.
Alice unfreezes Bob's account.
Alice burns 50 coins from Bob.
Bob's updated MoonCoin balance: 50.
Bob transfers 10 coins to Alice as the owner.
Alice's updated MoonCoin balance: 10.
Bob's updated MoonCoin balance: 40.
```

## Step 4: MoonCoin in depth

### Step 4.1: Building and publishing the MoonCoin package

Move contracts are effectively a set of Move modules known as a package. When deploying or upgrading a new package, the compiler must be invoked with `--save-metadata` to publish the package. In the case of MoonCoin, the following output files are critical:

- `build/Examples/package-metadata.bcs`: Contains the metadata associated with the package.
- `build/Examples/bytecode_modules/moon_coin.mv`: Contains the bytecode for the `moon_coin.move` module.

These are read by the example and published to the Aptos blockchain:

<Tabs groupId="examples">
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

```typescript
:!: static/sdks/typescript/examples/typescript/your_fungible_asset.ts publish
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

    Coming soon.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

    Coming soon.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 4.2: Understanding the MoonCoin module

The MoonCoin module contains a function called `init_module` in which it creates a named metadata object that defines a type of FA called "Moon Coin" with a bunch of properties. The `init_module` function is called when the module is published. In this case, MoonCoin initializes the `Moon Coin` metadata object, owned by the owner of the account. According to the module code, the owner will be the admin of "Moon coin" so that they are entitled to manage "Moon Coin" under the fungible asset framework.

:::tip Managed Fungible Asset framework
[`Managed Fungible Asset`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/move-examples/fungible_asset/managed_fungible_asset/sources/managed_fungible_asset.move) is a full-fledged FA management framework for FAs directly managed by users. It provides convenience wrappers around different `refs` and both primary and secondary fungible stores. This example is a simplified version that only deal with primary stores.
:::

---

### Step 4.3: Understanding the management primitives of MoonCoin

The creator of MoonCoin have several managing primitives:

- **Minting**: Creating new coins.
- **Burning**: Deleting coins.
- **Freezing/Unfreezing**: Disabling/Enabling the owner of an account to withdraw from or deposit to their primary fungible store of MoonCoin.
- **Withdraw**: Withdrawing MoonCoin from the primary store of any account regardless of being frozen or not.
- **Deposit**: Deposit MoonCoin from the primary store of any account regardless of being frozen or not.
- **Transfer**: Withdraw from one account and deposit to another regardless of either being frozen or not.

:::tip
The entity that creates MoonCoin gains the capabilities for minting, burning, freezing/unfreezing, and forceful transferring between any fungible stores no matter they are frozen or not.
So `Withdraw`, `Deposit`, and `Transfer` in the management module have different semantics than those described in fungible asset framework that limited by frozen status.
:::

---

#### Step 4.3.1: Initializing "Moon Coin" metadata object

After publish the module to the Aptos blockchain, the entity that published that coin type should initialize a metadata object describing the information about this FA:

```rust title="moon_coin.move snippet"
:!: static/move-examples/fungible_asset/moon_coin/sources/MoonCoin.move initialize
```

This ensures that this FA type has never been initialized before using a named object. Notice the first line create a named object with a static seed, if the metadata object has been created it will abort.
Then we call `primary_fungible_store::create_primary_store_enabled_fungible_asset` to create a FA metadata resource inside the newly created object, most of the time you call this function to initialize
the metadata object. After this call, we generate all the `Refs` that are necessary for the management api and store them in a customized wrapper resource.

:::tip
MoonCoin does all the initialization automatically upon package publishing via `init_module(&signer)`.
:::

Different from coin module, FA doesn't require users to register to use it because primary store will be automatically created if necessary.

---

#### Step 4.3.3: Managing a coin

Minting coins requires `MintRef` that was produced during initialization. the function `mint` (see below) takes in the creator and an amount, and returns a `FungibleAsset` struct containing that amount of FA. If the FA tracks supply, it will be updated.

```rust title="moon_coin.move snippet"
:!: static/move-examples/fungible_asset/moon_coin/sources/MoonCoin.move mint
```

`MoonCoin` makes this easier by providing an entry function `moon_coin::mint` that accesses the required `MintRef` for the creator.

Similarly, the module provides `burn`, `set_frozen_flag`, `transfer`, `Withdraw` and `Deposit` functions to manage MoonCoin following the same pattern with different refs.

---

#### Step 4.3.4: API of Transferring FAs

Aptos provides several APIs to support FA flows with same names in different modules:

- `fungible_asset::{transfer/withdraw/deposit}`: Move FA between different unfrozen fungible stores objects.
- `fungible_asset::{transfer/withdraw/deposit}_with_ref`: Move FA between different fungible stores objects with the corresponding `TransferRef` regardless their frozen status.
- `primary_fungible_store::{transfer/withdraw/deposit}`: Move FA between unfrozen primary stores of different accounts.

:::tip important
There are two separate withdraw and deposit events instead of a single transfer event.
